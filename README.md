debian package management

This is an app developed by a sysadmin, Im not a php developer at all and has been put together from various sources and help
from various people who probably have no idea what they where looking at.

Goal is
I wanted to create something to ease the task of having to manually go through mutiple servers and verify patches or security updates without a huge cost involved or trying to use something that was designed for RedHat/Centos etc eg spacewalk.

This is still very much in early stages and doesnt work properly as I envisage it as of this point
